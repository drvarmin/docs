# Complete Linear Issue

When invoked, the user will provide an **issue ID** (e.g. `ABC-123`) after the command.

## Steps
1. Fetch the Linear issue by id via the Linear MCP server
1. Use the git branch name from the issue (if not already on a branch off from main)
2. Read the issue title, description, and comments to gain full context
3. Look through the relevant parts of the codebase
4. Think through the problem and solution in detail, make sure to take the simplest path that will complete the issue properly.
5. Outline step-by-step implementation with numbered steps and bullet points   
6. Before proceeding with any changes, check in and ask me for approval for the plan, and if you need to, any clarifying questions
