title: "registerPlacement()"
description: "A function that registers a placement that can be remotely configured to show a paywall and gate feature access."
---

## Purpose
Registers a placement so that when it's added to a campaign on the Superwall Dashboard, it can trigger a paywall and optionally gate access to a feature.

## Signature
```dart
Future<void> registerPlacement(
  String placement, {
  Map<String, Object>? params,
  PaywallPresentationHandler? handler,
  Function()? feature,
})
```

```dart
Future<void> registerPlacement(
  String placement, {
  Map<String, Object>? params,
  PaywallPresentationHandler? handler,
})
```

## Parameters
<ParamTable>
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `placement` | `String` | The name of the placement you wish to register. |
| `params` | `Map<String, Object>?` | Optional parameters to pass with your placement. These can be referenced within campaign rules. Keys beginning with `$` are reserved for Superwall and will be dropped. Nested maps and lists are currently unsupported and will be ignored. Defaults to `null`. |
| `handler` | `PaywallPresentationHandler?` | A handler whose functions provide status updates for the paywall lifecycle. Defaults to `null`. | 
| `feature` | `Function()?` | A callback representing the gated feature. It is executed based on the paywall's gating mode: called immediately for **Non-Gated**, called after the user subscribes or if already subscribed for **Gated**. |
</ParamTable>

## Returns / State
This function returns a `Future<void>`. If you supply a `feature` callback, it will be executed according to the paywall's gating configuration, as described above.

## Usage
```dart
await Superwall.shared.registerPlacement(
  "premium_feature",
  params: {"source": "onboarding"},
  feature: () {
    // Code that unlocks the premium feature
    openPremiumScreen();
  },
);
```

```dart
await Superwall.shared.registerPlacement(
  "onboarding_complete",
  params: {"source": "onboarding"},
  handler: myHandler,
);
```
