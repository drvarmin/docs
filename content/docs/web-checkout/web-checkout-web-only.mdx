You can use Superwall's [web checkout links](/docs/web-checkout/web-checkout-creating-campaigns-to-show-paywalls) without an iOS or Android app. It's suitable for things like a web app, SaaS products, or any scenario where you want to handle the post-purchase flow yourself.

All that's required is creating a web app in Superwall. Then, for its post-purchase behavior use **Redirect mode** instead of _Redeem_ mode:

<Frame>![](/images/webcheckout-noapp-redirect.png)</Frame>

After a user completes checkout from a paywall, they get redirected to your URL with purchase data as query parameters:

<Frame>![](/images/webcheckout-noapp-redirect-url.png)</Frame>

For example, if your redirect URL is `https://amazingwebproduct.com/welcome`, then after a successful purchase the redirect URL would be the following:

```javascript
https://amazingwebproduct.com/welcome?
  app_user_id=user_123&
  email=user@example.com&
  stripe_subscription_id=sub_1234567890
```

## Setup

### 1. Create a Superwall Web App

Create a new app in Superwall for your web product in a new or existing project. Follow the steps in [Creating an App](/web-checkout-creating-an-app).

### 2. Configure Your Payment Provider

Set up your Stripe:

- [Stripe Setup](/web-checkout-configuring-stripe-keys-and-settings)

<Note>Paddle is not currently supported in this flow, but it does work in app to web scenarios.</Note>

You can skip any iOS/Android related configuration sections since you won't be using a mobile app.

### 3. Enable Redirect Mode

In your app's settings under **Post-Purchase Behavior**, select **Redirect** and enter your custom URL.

Your URL will receive the following query parameters after checkout:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `app_user_id` | The user's identifier (if you set one) |
| `email` | User's email from checkout |
| `stripe_subscription_id` | The Stripe subscription ID |
| Custom parameters | Any placement parameters you set |

**Example redirect:**
```javascript
https://amazingwebproduct.com/welcome?
  app_user_id=user_123&
  email=user@example.com&
  stripe_subscription_id=sub_1234567890
```

### 4. Handle the Redirect

When users land on your redirect URL, use the query parameters to:

- Verify the purchase with your backend.
- Create or update the user's account.
- Grant access to your product.
- Show a success or onboarding page.

## What's Next

- [Creating Products](/web-checkout-adding-a-stripe-product) to add products to your checkout.
- [Creating Campaigns](/web-checkout-creating-campaigns-to-show-paywalls) to show paywalls via  web checkout links. Remember, you use these URLs in any way you wish, but the checkout link itself is derived from two things:

1) The web paywall domain you created for the web app (found in Settings -> General).
2) And, the placement which is housed in a campaign.
