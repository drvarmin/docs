  <Accordion title="Showing different paywalls">
    **The What**<br />
    Using [audiences](campaigns-audience) within a campaign, you can:

    1. Show unique paywalls for each one.
    2. And, within an audience, you can show multiple paywalls based on a [percentage](/campaigns-audience#paywalls).

    **The Why**<br />
    Our data clearly demonstrates that showing the right paywall, to the right user, and at the right time dramatically affects revenue. There is rarely a one-size-fits all paywall, so you should be testing different variations of them often.

    **The How**<br />

<Accordion title="Abandoned transaction discounts">
  **The What**<br />
    Transaction abandon discounts can boost revenue by offering discounts to users who start, but don't complete, in-app purchases. We've seen 25-40% of revenue come from this method in a few of our own apps, and it can be implemented in Superwall without an app update.

    **The Why**<br />
    Somewhere around only 50% of users complete in-app purchases once they start. Offering discounts to those who showed interest, but hesitated, can convert them into paying customers.

    **The How**<br />

<Accordion title="Presenting paywalls from the first touch">
  **The What**<br />
    App installs to paywall views is one of the most critical metrics you can track. Using the first touch event to present a paywall is a great way to boost it.

    **The Why**<br />
    Showing a paywall from the user's first touch can be an effective alternative to showing one simply after the app launches. This way, it feels less "in the way" and much less like a popup a user had no control over — while still ensuring users view your products.

    **The How**<br />
