<Warning>
Note that Superwall does **not** refetch its configuration during hot reloads. So, if you add products, edit a paywall, or otherwise change anything with Superwall, re-run your app to see those changes.
</Warning>

## Option 1: React-Native package

To use Superwall in your React Native project, add `@superwall/react-native-superwall` as a dependency in your `package.json` file by using npm or yarn:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @superwall/react-native-superwall
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @superwall/react-native-superwall
```

</CodeGroup>

## Option 2: Using Expo

If you have an Expo project, you can add the dependency with npx:

```
npx expo install @superwall/react-native-superwall
```

Please note that Superwall does not support Expo Go. Expo Go only supports prebuilt Expo libraries; it cannot load third-party SDKs with custom native code. If you are using a **managed workflow**, create a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/overview/#development-builds) to continue using Expo tools while including Superwall. Otherwise, you will encounter linking errors.

Here's a quick table to review your installation methods:

| **Workflow**               | **Superwall Support**                    | **Notes**                              |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Expo Go**                | ❌ Not supported                       | Expo Go cannot load native SDKs.      |
| **Managed Workflow**       | ℹ️ Requires additional step      | Use a **Development Build**.  |
| **Development Build**      | ✅ Supported                           | Works with Expo tools + custom code.  |
| **Unmanaged (Bare)**       | ✅ Supported                           | Full control over native code.        |


### iOS Deployment Target

Superwall requires iOS 14.0 or higher. Ensure your React Native project's iOS deployment target is 14.0 or higher by updating ios/Podfile.

```ruby
platform :ios, '14.0'
```

## Android Configuration

For Android projects, you'll also need to include Superwall's Maven repository.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Expo Projects">
First, install the `expo-build-properties` config plugin if your Expo project hasn’t yet:

```bash
npx expo install expo-build-properties
```

Then, add the following to your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      ...
      [
        "expo-build-properties",
        {
          "android": {
            "minSdkVersion": 26
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Non-Expo Projects">
Superwall requires a minimum SDK version of 26 or higher. Ensure your React Native project's Android SDK target is set to 26 or higher by updating `android/app/build.gradle`.

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 26
        ...
    }
}
```
