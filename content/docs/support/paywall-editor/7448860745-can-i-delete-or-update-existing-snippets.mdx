title: "Can I delete or update existing snippets?"
---


While snippets cannot be deleted, you can update existing snippets rather than creating new ones. This helps keep your snippet library clean and up-to-date.

To update an existing snippet:

1.  Make your desired changes to the snippet element or stack
    
2.  Click "Create Snippet"
    
3.  When prompted, select the option to update the existing snippet instead of creating a new one
