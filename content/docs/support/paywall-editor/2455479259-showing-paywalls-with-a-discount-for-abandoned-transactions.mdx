Unlocking some lost revenue with transaction abandoned discounts. In this short tutorial, we'll show you how to get things setup in Superwall to show discounted products when someone starts a transaction, but cancels it. Best of all, if you have the Superwall SDK installed - there's no app updates you need to make.

This technique has boosted revenue by 25-40% in several apps using Superwall. Around only 50% of users complete an in-app purchase after starting one. If your trial rate is 10%, that means 20% of installs are considering a purchase. Users who tap the buy button show interest but may hesitate at the full price. So, offer them a discount!
