title: "Are video and images automatically compressed when uploaded to a paywall via the editor?"
---


Answer
------

Yes, when you upload a video through the editor for use in a paywall, it will automatically be compressed for you. This automatic compression helps optimize the video for web delivery while maintaining quality.

Although we will compress video, there is still a minimum amount of bandwidth and therefore latency which you will incur by using long videos or many images. We recommend sticking to 3-10 second videos and less than 20 images.

Video compression happens automatically in the background - there's no additional action needed on your part.
