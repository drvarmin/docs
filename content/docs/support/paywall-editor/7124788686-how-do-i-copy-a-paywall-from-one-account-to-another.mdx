title: "How do I copy a paywall from one account to another?"

Answer
------

You can easily share a paywall between different Superwall accounts using the built-in sharing feature. Here's how:

1.  Open the paywall you want to share in the Paywall Editor
    
2.  Click the **Share** icon in the editor
    
3.  Click **Generate a link** to create a shareable URL
    
4.  Send that link to the person with the other account
    
5.  When they open the link, the paywall will be duplicated into their Superwall project
    

**Important:** The duplicated paywall will come without your existing products. The recipient will need to attach their own products to the paywall after importing it.

To make the paywall private again after sharing, click the **Share** button and select **Take Private**.
