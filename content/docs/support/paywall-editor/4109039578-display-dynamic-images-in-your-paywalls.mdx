You can use variables inside of image URLs in Superwall's editor to show dynamic content. This is perfect for:

*   Sports apps who want to promote a certain game
    
*   Dating apps might show a tapped profile
    
*   Community gathering apps could show a particular event
    

You'll have access to the vast array of variables available in the editor, feel free to get creative!
