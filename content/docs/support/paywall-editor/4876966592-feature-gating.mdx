You can change what's "paywalled" in production any time by using "Feature Gating", an available setting on every paywall you've created with Superwall. When you have it enabled, it means users will see a paywall if they aren't "pro" and Superwall will restrict access to features. On the other hand, disabling it means that users will still see a paywall, but the "pro" content will be available to them once it dismisses.

This is an effective technique to run promotions or during onboarding. Users still see a paywall, giving you a shot at conversion, but also get to experience pro features that will hopefully convince them to convert later on.
