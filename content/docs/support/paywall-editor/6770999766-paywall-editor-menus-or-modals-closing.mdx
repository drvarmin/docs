title: "Paywall Editor: Menus or Modals Closing"

If you experience issues with Menus or Modals automatically closing while editing your paywall, this may be caused by browser extensions interfering with the editors functionality.

### Debugging
- Open the Paywall Editor in an Incognito/Private window
- Temporarily disable your browser extensions

If the issue stops, then it could be one of your browser extensions causing the issue.
