Dynamic values are a core part of the Superwall editor. Using them, you can update all sorts of things in your paywalls depending on a certain condition:

*   If there's a free trial, show this button.
    
*   If they select this plan, update that text.
    
*   If it's on an iPad, show these components.
    
*   etc.
    

Here, developer advocate Jordan will walk you through how they work, and how to use existing dynamic values already present on a paywall.
