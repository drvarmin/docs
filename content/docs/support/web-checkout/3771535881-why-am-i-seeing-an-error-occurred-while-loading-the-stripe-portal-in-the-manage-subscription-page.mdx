![Stripe Portal Error](/images/stripe-portal-error.png)

If you encounter an error when trying to access the "Manage Subscription" page Stripe Portal through a web2app redemption link, this typically means that the customer portal configuration for sandbox environment has not been set up in your Stripe account yet.

To resolve this issue:

1.  Go to your Stripe Dashboard's Customer Portal settings page: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal)
    
2.  Configure your customer portal settings for the sandbox/test environment
    
3.  Save your configuration
    

Once configured, the Stripe Portal should load correctly when accessing it through the redemption link.

Note: Our team is working on automating this setup process to prevent this error from occurring in the future.
