title: "Why is my transaction failure rate high?"

What is a "Failed Checkout"?
----------------------------

A failed checkout occurs when a user taps to purchase, the payment sheet appears (Apple Pay or Google Pay), but the payment system returns an error before the transaction completes.

Common Causes
-------------

Failed checkouts are typically caused by:

*   **Declined payment methods**: Insufficient funds, expired cards, or invalid payment details

*   **Fraud prevention**: Apple or Google's systems blocking suspicious transactions

*   **Network issues**: Connectivity problems during the payment flow

*   **User cancellation**: User dismissing the payment sheet after it appears


What's a Normal Failure Rate?
-----------------------------

A transaction failure rate of **5-6%** is within industry standards. Some variance is expected depending on your audience demographics and geographic distribution.

What You Can and Can't Control
------------------------------

### Can't control

These failures happen entirely within Apple's or Google's payment infrastructure, between the user and their payment provider. Neither Superwall nor your app can influence these outcomes.

### Can control

While you can't prevent payment-side failures, you can optimize:

*   **Paywall UX**: Clear pricing and value proposition

*   **Audience targeting**: Showing paywalls to users more likely to convert

*   **Timing**: Presenting offers at optimal moments in the user journey
