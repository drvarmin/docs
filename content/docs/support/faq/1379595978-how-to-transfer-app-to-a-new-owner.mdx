title: "How to Transfer Your App to a New Owner"
---


When selling or transferring your app to a new owner, you'll need to transfer the associated Superwall account as well. Here's how the transfer process works:

Transfer Process
----------------

1.  Contact Superwall support when you're ready to transfer ownership
    
2.  Provide the email address of the new owner (they must have a Superwall account)
    
3.  A Superwall team member will transfer the app to the new owner's account
    
4.  The new owner then has full access to the app
    

Note: The transfer must be performed by Superwall support staff - there is no self-service option for account transfers.

What Gets Transferred
---------------------

The transfer includes:

*   App configuration and settings
    
*   Historical data and analytics
    
*   All associated paywalls and campaigns
    

After the transfer is complete, the previous owner will no longer have access to the app in their Superwall account.
