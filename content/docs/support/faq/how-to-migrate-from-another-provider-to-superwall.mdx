# How do I migrate to Superwall from another subscription provider?

If you're currently using a subscription management provider like Adapty, Qonversion, Glassfy, or another SDK and want to migrate to Superwall, here's what you need to know.

## Will My Existing Subscribers Keep Their Access?

**Yes.** Superwall reads subscription status directly from the device's App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android) records. This means:

- Existing subscribers are automatically recognized when you switch SDKs
- No manual migration of subscription data is required
- Users won't experience any interruption to their access

When a user opens your app with the new Superwall SDK, their active subscriptions are detected automatically, regardless of which SDK was used to originally make the purchase.

## What Gets Migrated Automatically

| Data | Migrated? |
|------|-----------|
| Active subscription status | ✅ Yes - read directly from the device |
| Entitlement access | ✅ Yes - based on active subscriptions |
| Cross-device sync (same Apple ID/Google account) | ✅ Yes |

## What Does NOT Migrate

| Data | Migrated? |
|------|-----------|
| Historical analytics and metrics | ❌ No |
| Paywall designs and configurations | ❌ No - must be recreated in Superwall |
| A/B test history and experiment data | ❌ No |
| Custom user attributes from previous SDK | ❌ No - must be re-set via Superwall SDK |

## Migration Steps

1. Remove your current subscription SDK from your project
2. Follow the [Superwall installation guide](/docs/getting-started-with-our-sdks) for your platform

## Troubleshooting

### Subscription status not detected

If an existing subscriber isn't being recognized:

1. Have them tap "Restore Purchases" on any paywall
2. Ensure they're signed into the same App Store/Google Play account used for the original purchase
3. Check that the subscription hasn't expired
