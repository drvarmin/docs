title: "How does Superwall's pricing work?"
---


Overview
========

Superwall is changing it's pricing from being based on conversions to being based on MAR (monthly _attributed_ revenue).

If you're an **existing customer** you can **choose** to stay on the legacy plan or upgrade

New Pricing (MAR-based)
=======================

See our [pricing page](https://superwall.com/pricing) for the breakdown of our pricing tiers.

The new Superwall pricing offers different tiers of service for a monthly subscription, and charges based on a percentage of MAR, where under $10k MAR is free.

*   **Indie**: $0 / month
    
*   **Startup**: $49 / month
    
*   **Scale**: $199 / month
    
*   **Enterprise**: Custom, [contact us!](https://superwall.com/contact/book-a-demo)

What is MAR?
------------

MAR is **Monthly Attributed Revenue**, which is _not_ the same as Monthly Revenue. MAR is only revenue that is attributed to a Superwall paywall.

TL;DR: you only pay for revenue that Superwall has directly helped you get.

Legacy (Conversion-based)
=========================

Legacy pricing is only available for existing customers

Superwall offers different pricing tiers based on the number of paywall conversions. Understanding what counts as a conversion and how pricing works is important for choosing the right plan.

Superwall offers three pricing tiers:

*   **Indie (Free):** Up to 250 free conversions per month
    
*   **Startup ($0.20/conversion):** Pay-as-you-go pricing, with first 250 conversions free each month
    
*   **Growth (Flat-Rate):** Custom flat-rate pricing with unlimited conversions
    

What is a Conversion?
---------------------

A "conversion" in Superwall's pricing refers to when a user makes a purchase through a Superwall paywall. Here are specific examples of what counts as a conversion:

*   A user starting a free trial for a subscription
    
*   A user making a paid one-time in-app purchase through a paywall
    
*   A user subscribing to a monthly plan directly through a paywall
    

Subscription renewals and trials converting to paid subscriptions do NOT count as conversions.

Pricing for High-Volume Apps
----------------------------

For apps using the Startup tier ($0.20/conversion) that exceed 5,000 conversions per month:

*   You **can continue using the Startup plan** at the same rate of $0.20 per conversion
    
*   However, at this volume it may make sense to explore to our flat-rate Growth plan. When you reach this size [we'd love to talk](https://superwall.com/contact/book-a-demo)!
