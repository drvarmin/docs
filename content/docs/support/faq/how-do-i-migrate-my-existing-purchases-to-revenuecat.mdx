title: "How do I migrate my existing purchases to RevenueCat?"
---


Overview
--------

If you're migrating to RevenueCat, Superwall can help export your existing user and purchase data to facilitate the transition.

What We Can Export
------------------

*   **User IDs**: Your Superwall app user identifiers

*   **Original Transaction IDs**: Apple's unique subscription identifiers

Note: We don't have access to receipts or receipt-type metadata, but RevenueCat has historically accepted original transaction IDs for migration purposes.

The Process
-----------

1.  **Open a support ticket with RevenueCat**: They'll provide specific requirements for the data import

2.  **Contact Superwall support**: Once RevenueCat confirms what they need, let us know and we'll coordinate the export

3.  **Receive your CSV**: We'll provide a CSV with `app_user_id` and `store_transaction_id` columns

RevenueCat recommends excluding sandbox transactions if appropriate, as sandbox volume can be very large.

Pricing
-------

*   **First 1,000 users:** Free

*   **Additional users:** $0.20 per exported subscription
