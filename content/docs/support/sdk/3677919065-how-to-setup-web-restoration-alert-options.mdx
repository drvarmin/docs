Setup Web Restoration Alert
===========================

To configure the web restoration alert behavior in your Superwall integration:

1.  Access your application's PaywallOptions configuration
    
2.  Set the `shouldShowWebRestorationAlert` property to control when the alert appears:
    
        PaywallOptions.shouldShowWebRestorationAlert = false
    

Setting this property to false will suppress the web restoration alert, which is particularly useful when users already have an active StoreKit subscription.

Usage
=====

The web restoration alert is designed to check for web-based subscriptions during the restore purchase flow. By default, this alert may appear even when users have an existing StoreKit subscription. To optimize the user experience:

*   Disable the web restoration alert if your app primarily uses StoreKit subscriptions
    
*   Enable the alert only in scenarios where checking for web-based subscriptions is necessary
    

Note: The alert button text currently displays as "Okay" and cannot be customized. This is a standard part of the SDK's interface.
