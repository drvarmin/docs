title: "Why am I getting PlacementNotFound errors for active placements in Expo?"

Answer
------

If you're seeing PlacementNotFound errors for placements that are active in your dashboard while using Expo, this is because the SDK doesn't automatically update to reflect your latest dashboard changes during development.

To resolve this issue:

1.  Completely quit your Expo development app
    
2.  Relaunch the app to load the updated placement configuration
    

The SDK requires a full restart to sync with any changes made in the dashboard, including newly created or modified placements.

Hot reloading support is planned for future releases, but currently a full app restart is required after making any placement changes in the dashboard.
