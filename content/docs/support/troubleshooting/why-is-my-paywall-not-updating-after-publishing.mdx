title: "Why is my paywall not updating after publishing?"
description: "Troubleshoot why users may still see an outdated paywall after you've made and published updates in the Superwall dashboard"
---

## Quick Checklist

Before diving into detailed troubleshooting, verify these common causes:

- [ ] Have you **published** the paywall after making changes?
- [ ] Is the user **assigned to a different paywall** in an A/B test?
- [ ] Are you using **conditional visibility** (e.g., `hasIntroductoryOffer`) that shows different content?
- [ ] Has the user's **trial eligibility** changed, showing a different UI state?

---

## Step 1: Verify the Paywall is Published

Changes made in the paywall editor are saved locally but not live until published.

**To check:**
1. Open the paywall in the editor
2. Look for the **Publish** button in the top-right
3. If it's clickable, your changes haven't been published yet

**Note:** Publishing a paywall doesn't automatically update users who have already been assigned to it in an experiment.

---

## Step 2: Check Campaign and Experiment Setup

### Multiple Paywalls in a Campaign

If your campaign has multiple paywalls (an A/B test), users are randomly assigned to one variant. The user seeing an "outdated" paywall may simply be assigned to a different variant than the one you updated.

**To check:**
1. Go to **Campaigns** → Select your campaign
2. Look at the **Paywalls** tab for the relevant audience
3. Verify which paywalls are active and their distribution percentages

### Sticky Assignments

**Important:** Superwall assignments are "sticky." Once a user is assigned to a paywall variant, they continue seeing that same paywall regardless of:
- Changes you make to presentation percentages
- Updates you publish to other paywalls
- App reinstalls or calling `Superwall.reset()`

This is by design. It ensures experiment integrity and allows you to keep existing users on an old pricing while testing new pricing with new users.

## Step 3: Check Conditional Visibility and Dynamic Values

Paywalls often use **dynamic values** to show different content based on conditions. The most common scenario is **trial eligibility**.

### Trial Eligibility (`products.hasIntroductoryOffer`)

If your paywall has components with visibility controlled by `products.hasIntroductoryOffer`:
- **True:** User is eligible for a free trial/intro offer
- **False:** User has already used their trial (or the product has no trial)

**Common issue:** Apple App Store reviewers often test with accounts that have already used trials, so `hasIntroductoryOffer` is `false` for them, showing different UI than you expect.

**To check in the editor:**
1. Open your paywall in the editor
2. Click **Variables** in the floating toolbar
3. Toggle `products.hasIntroductoryOffer` between true/false
4. Observe which components appear/disappear

### Other Dynamic Conditions

Check if any components have visibility rules based on:
- Selected product index
- Device type
- User attributes
- Custom parameters

Look for components that have the **gear icon** indicating dynamic values are set.

## Step 4: Verify Products Are Correctly Configured

### Product Approval Status

Products must be approved in App Store Connect before they can be properly displayed:
- Products in "Waiting for Review" may not load correctly
- Sandbox testing uses different product states than production

**To check:**
1. Go to App Store Connect → Your App → Subscriptions
2. Verify all products show "Ready to Submit" or "Approved"

### Product Assignment on Paywall

Ensure the correct products are assigned to your paywall:
1. Open the paywall in the editor
2. Check the **Products** section on the left sidebar
3. Verify the intended products are selected as Primary, Secondary, etc.

---

## Step 5: Understand Caching Behavior

### Server-Side Caching

Superwall's static configuration is cached by CDN for up to **1 hour**. After publishing changes:
- New users get the update immediately (fresh cache)
- Existing users may see cached content for up to 1 hour

### Device-Side Caching

If your paywall has **Cache on Device** enabled in settings:
- The SDK stores the paywall locally for faster presentation
- Reinstalling the app clears this cache
- `Superwall.reset()` clears on-device data but NOT server-side assignments

---

## Step 6: Testing Checklist

When testing paywall updates, follow this process:

### For Fresh Testing
1. Wait a few minutes for cache propagation
2. Use a **new user ID** or test account
3. Delete and reinstall the app
4. Trigger the placement that shows the paywall

### For App Store Review
1. Remember reviewers may not be eligible for trials (trial already used)
2. Test your paywall with `hasIntroductoryOffer = false` in the editor
3. Ensure all UI states look correct for non-trial-eligible users

## Common Scenarios and Solutions

| Scenario | Likely Cause | Solution |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| User sees old paywall copy | Sticky assignment to old variant | Wait for new users or use new test account |
| User sees different products | Assigned to different A/B variant | Check which variant user is assigned to |
| Trial text showing when user isn't eligible | `hasIntroductoryOffer` conditional visibility | Check dynamic values on text components |
| Non-trial text showing for trial-eligible user | Same as above, inverted | Verify conditional logic in editor |
| Changes not visible after publishing | CDN cache or device cache | Wait up to 1 hour, or reinstall app |
| App Store reviewer sees wrong content | Reviewer's trial eligibility differs | Design for both trial/non-trial states |
