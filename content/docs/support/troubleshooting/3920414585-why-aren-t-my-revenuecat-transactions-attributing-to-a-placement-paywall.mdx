title: "Why aren't my transactions attributing to a placement/paywall?"
---


Only if you're using a PurchaseController, if you are using Superwall for subscription handling logic, this does not apply

Symptoms
--------

![RevenueCat Attribution Issue Example](/images/rc-attribution-issue-example.png)

*   In the Overview tab under recent transactions, you see transactions like the above, where "Placement" and "Paywall" are missing and not set
    
*   On a user page you see no "Transaction Complete"
    

This means that Superwall can't **attribute** this purchase event we received from the App Store / RevenueCat back to a purchase made through a Superwall paywall. If the purchase was made through a Superwall paywall, then it signals some disconnect between Superwall and App Store / RevenueCat.

Debugging Steps
---------------

*   Update to the latest SDKs, we're always fixing bugs and improving features
    
*   Make sure only offering subscriptions/products through superwall paywalls. if available elsewhere then we won't be able to attribute back to placement/paywall
    
*   Check that you have Revenue Tracking properly set up, and you see events in Settings
    
*   Check that your PurchaseController code matches our example code [here](https://superwall.com/docs/sdk/guides/using-revenuecat)
    

### If Using RevenueCat:

*   Check that all of your products are listed on both the Superwall and RevenueCat dashboards, and they all have entitlements, and the entitlements match **exactly**
    
*   Check that you're calling `Superwall.shared.identify` with the same user id that RevenueCat has
