Understanding Pending Trials
----------------------------

If you're seeing trials that remain in "pending" status long after the trial period should have ended, this is usually expected behavior related to how Apple handles billing.

Common Causes
-------------

### Billing Retry Period

When a user has a billing issue (e.g., expired card, insufficient funds), Apple doesn't immediately cancel the subscription. Instead, Apple will **retry billing for up to 16 days**. During this entire period, the trial remains in "pending" status in Superwall.

### Billing Grace Period

Your billing grace period setting in App Store Connect affects how long users stay in pending status. This is configurable and can be tuned based on your preferences.

What You Can Do
---------------

*   **Check App Store Connect** — Review your billing grace period settings and adjust if needed

*   **Expect some delay** — It's normal to see a significant number of pending trials due to billing retries

*   **Wait for resolution** — Most pending trials will resolve within 16 days as either converted or cancelled
