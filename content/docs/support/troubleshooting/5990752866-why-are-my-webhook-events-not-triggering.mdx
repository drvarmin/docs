title: "Why are my webhook events not triggering?"

Context

Webhook events may not trigger if certain requirements aren't met or if the configuration isn't properly set up. This article explains the common reasons and how to resolve them.

The primary requirement for Webhooks to function properly is that they need to be configured with App Store events. Here's how to set this up and troubleshoot common issues:

1.  Configure App Store Integration: - Go to Settings / Revenue Tracking
    
2.  Switch to App Store Connect for events and set up the integration
    
3.  Once events from the App Store are sending, you can then switch back to your preferred revenue tracking service (e.g., RevenueCat)
    

When testing on iOS using local StoreKit transactions (StoreKit Configuration file or StoreKitTest in Xcode), webhook events won't trigger as these don't generate App Store Server Notifications. Use TestFlight or a sandbox Apple ID for testing webhook delivery.
