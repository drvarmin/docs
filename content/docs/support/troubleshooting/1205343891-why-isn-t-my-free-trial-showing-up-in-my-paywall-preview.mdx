title: "Why isn't my free trial showing up in my paywall?"
---


When a free trial or introductory offer isn't appearing in your paywall, this is typically related to either offer eligibility or App Store Connect setup.

Offer Eligibility
-----------------

If you've already subscribed to any subscription in a Subscription Group, then you will no longer be eligible for that Introductory Offer.

To clear your state and continue testing the offer, you need to reset your eligibility in settings, follow Apple's guide here: [**Testing introductory offers**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/testing-introductory-offers)

App Store Connect Setup
-----------------------

Verify that the introductory offer is correctly set up in App Store Connect for your product ID.

To check this, go to **App Store Connect → My Apps → Your App → In-App Purchases → \[Your Subscription\] → Subscription Prices → Introductory Offers**.

Make sure the offer is active, properly configured for the right **base plan**, and that your app’s build uses the same **product identifier**.

Superwall does not control whether a product has a free trial or not, Introductory offers are handled directly by Apple
