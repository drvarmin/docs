title: "Why does my subscription status remain INACTIVE after successful purchase?"
---


Context
-------

When implementing subscriptions in your iOS app with Superwall, you might notice that the subscription status remains INACTIVE even after a successful purchase transaction. This can affect your app's flow and user access to premium features.

Answer
------

If you are using Superwall for purchase handling:

*   You need to configure [Entitlements](https://superwall.com/docs/dashboard/products#entitlements) for all of your products in the Superwall dashboard:
    
    *   Navigate to the Products tab in your Superwall dashboard
        
    *   Add Entitlements to all of your products
        

If you are **not** using Superwall for purchase handling, and you're using a [PurchaseController](https://superwall.com/docs/using-revenuecat#using-revenuecat):

*   Your PurchaseController is in charge of setting the user's subscription status
    
    *   Check that your implementation matches our [example code](https://superwall.com/docs/using-revenuecat#using-revenuecat)
        
    *   Check that syncSubscriptionStatus is called on launch
        
    *   Check that all of your products are listed on both the Superwall and RevenueCat dashboards, and they all have entitlements, and the entitlements match **exactly**
