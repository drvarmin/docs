If you're seeing unexpected behavior in production and know the `userId`, here's how to debug:

1. **Search for the user in the dashboard.**
   Go to the Users tab and enter their `userId`. Click the result to see their event log.

2. **Check the `paywallPresentationRequest` event.**
   Look for this event in the log. It includes a `status` and `status_reason` that explains why a paywall did or didn’t show.

3. **Common error: `subscription_status_timeout`**
   This means it took longer than 5 seconds to retrieve the subscription status. Check if `Superwall.shared.subscriptionStatus` is being set correctly or if there's an internet issue.

4. **Tip:** Use the same `userId` across analytics and Superwall via `identify(userId:)`.
