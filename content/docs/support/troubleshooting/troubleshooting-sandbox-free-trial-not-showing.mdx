title: "Sandbox Free Trial Isn’t Appearing"
description: "Why free trials sometimes don’t show up in sandbox testing and what to do about it."
---

This can happen when you've previously purchased a subscription and then reinstall the app during sandbox testing. The issue:

- The on-device receipt is used to determine trial availability.
- In sandbox, this receipt isn’t retrieved until after a purchase or restore.
- So the SDK can’t determine if a free trial is available at app start.

**Fix:**
Restore purchases first, then try again. This won’t happen in production.
