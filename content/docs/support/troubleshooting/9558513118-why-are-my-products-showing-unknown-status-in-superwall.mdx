![Products Unknown Status](/images/products-unknown-status.png)

Products showing an "Unknown" status in the Products tab indicates an issue with Superwall's connection to App Store Connect, here's how to resolve it.

Debugging Steps
===============

*   Set up the App Store Connect API configuration in your Superwall dashboard
    

*   **Product IDs**: check that they match **exactly** across Superwall and App Store Connect
    
*   **IDs in Settings / General**: check that the following are set correctly in the Superwall dashboard and match what's in App Store connect exactly:
    
    *   App ID
        
    *   Bundle ID
        
    *   Team ID
        
*   **App Store Connect API Key permissions**: check that your API key has the "App Manager" role and access to your app
    
*   **Unsigned agreements**: Check if your developer agreement needs to be re-approved in App Store Connect. Even with proper API configuration, products may show "Unknown" status if your developer agreement has expired or needs re-approval
    

**Important**: This is not _required_ for Superwall to work, but is strongly recommended to help keep track of your products status.
