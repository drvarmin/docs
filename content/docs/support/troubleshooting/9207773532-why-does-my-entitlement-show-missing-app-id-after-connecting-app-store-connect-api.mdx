title: "Why does my entitlement show \"Missing App ID\" after connecting App Store Connect API?"
---


When setting up App Store Connect API integration with Superwall, you may see a "Missing App ID" warning next to your products even after connecting the API and adding product identifiers. This occurs when the Apple App ID hasn't been properly configured in your Superwall settings.

To resolve the "Missing App ID" warning:

1.  Go to Settings / General in your Superwall dashboard
    
2.  Locate the Apple App ID field
    
3.  Add your app's Apple App ID
    

This step is required for Superwall to properly fetch and verify your product status from App Store Connect. Once you've added the Apple App ID, the warning should be resolved and your products will be properly linked.

Note: Even if your App Store Connect API is properly configured and your product identifiers match exactly with App Store Connect, the "Missing App ID" warning will persist until you complete this configuration step.
