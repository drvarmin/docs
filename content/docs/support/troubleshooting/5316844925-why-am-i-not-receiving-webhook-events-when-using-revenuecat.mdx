title: "Why am I not receiving webhook events?"
---


Context
-------

When using Superwall alongside RevenueCat, you may encounter situations where webhook events are not being received or displayed in the webhooks dashboard.

Answer
------

There are two main scenarios where webhook events may not work correctly:

*   Using RevenueCat in observer mode while relying on it for events
    
*   Testing with a StoreKit configuration file
    

To ensure webhook events are working properly:

1.  Make sure you're sending real App Store events rather than only RevenueCat events
    
2.  Avoid using StoreKit configuration files for webhook testing
    

For accurate webhook testing, use real App Store transactions instead of RevenueCat events or StoreKit configuration files.
