title: "StoreKit Transactions Not Clearing in Xcode"
description: "Fix for when a test transaction seems stuck or active when it shouldn’t be."
---

Sometimes StoreKit test transactions appear active when they’re not. This is often due to a target membership issue or StoreKit config issue. To fix:

1. Open Xcode → **Debug → StoreKit → Manage Transactions**.
2. Delete all existing transactions.
3. If it still fails, remove the StoreKit config file from the project.
4. Build and run the project again.
5. Re-add the StoreKit config file.
