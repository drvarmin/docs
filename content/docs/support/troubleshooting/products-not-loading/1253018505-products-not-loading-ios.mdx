Symptoms
========

*   Prices not showing on paywall
    
*   Tapping purchase button on paywall doesn't do anything
    
*   Error logs saying products not loading
    

Debugging Steps
===============

Products not loading is a common issue when first setting up any app with subscriptions. This is a tried and true, all encompassing list of steps to debug.

Please double check every step, they are all required and _any_ misconfiguration can cause your products to not load.

Xcode
-----

*   Your app’s bundle ID **exactly** matches to App Store Connect
    
*   In-App Purchase capability is added to the project
    

Superwall Dashboard
-------------------

*   The paywall you're trying to open has a product added to it
    
*   All of your products are added in the [products tab](https://superwall.com/applications/:applicationId/products/v2), and have an Active status
    

App Store Connect
-----------------

*   No products are in **“Missing Metadata”** status
    
*   You have valid Localization set for all your subscription products and the subscription group(s)
    
*   Product IDs match your paywall on the Superwall Dashboard **exactly**
    
*   All agreements are active, there are no unsigned agreements (Business -> Agreements)
    
*   Tax and banking info is completely set up
    
*   You've waited at least 15 minutes after creating the products
    

After first releasing your app with in-app products or subscriptions, it can take up to 72 hours for them to appear. This is a limitation on Apple's end we cannot override.
