*   Tapping purchase button on paywall doesn't do anything
    
*   Error logs saying products not loading
    

Debugging Steps
===============

Products not loading is a common issue when first setting up any app with subscriptions. This is a tried and true, all encompassing list of steps to debug.

Please double check every step, they are all required and _any_ misconfiguration can cause your products to not load.

Superwall Dashboard
-------------------

*   The paywall you're trying to open has a product added to it
    
*   All of your products are added in the [products tab](https://superwall.com/applications/:applicationId/products/v2)
    

Google Play Store
-----------------

*   Ensure the device/emulator has the Play Store and is signed in.
    
*   Check that your `applicationId` matches what’s set in your project.
    
*   You've pushed at least one build with `com.android.vending.BILLING` to at least to one of your test tracks
    
*   You’ve linked a Google payments merchant account in the Play Console
    
*   Users in Russia and Belarus don’t have access to Google Billing.
    
    *   In this instance, products won’t load and paywalls won’t show. The `onErrorPaywallPresentationHandler` handler will get called.
