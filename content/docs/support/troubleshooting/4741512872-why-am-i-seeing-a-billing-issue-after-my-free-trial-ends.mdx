title: "Why am I seeing a billing issue after my free trial ends?"
---


When a free trial ends and there is a billing issue during the conversion to a paid subscription, this is handled entirely by Apple's/Google's billing system. This is a common scenario that can occur for various reasons on their end, such as expired credit cards or insufficient funds.

Here's what happens in this situation:
--------------------------------------

*   Apple will automatically attempt to resolve the billing issue on their end
    
*   If successful, the user will be converted to a paid subscription
    
*   No action is required from you or within the Superwall dashboard
    

How can I fix or prevent this?
------------------------------

Unfortunately as this is handled by the App Stores themselves, neither app developers nor Superwall can directly address or resolve these billing issues.
