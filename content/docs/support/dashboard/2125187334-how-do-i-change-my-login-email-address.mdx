Currently, it is not possible to directly change the email address associated with your Superwall account. However, you can follow these steps to set up access with a new email address:

1.  Invite your new email address as a team member to your Superwall project
    
2.  Create a separate account using the new email address
    
3.  Use the new account credentials to access your Superwall dashboard
