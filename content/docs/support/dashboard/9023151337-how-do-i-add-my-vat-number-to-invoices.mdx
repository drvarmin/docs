When you need to include your VAT number on invoices from Superwall, you can add it through the Billing Settings.

To add your VAT number:

1.  Go to Settings / Billing
    
2.  Locate your name field
    
3.  Add your VAT number next to your name
    

Once added, your VAT number will automatically appear on all future invoices.
