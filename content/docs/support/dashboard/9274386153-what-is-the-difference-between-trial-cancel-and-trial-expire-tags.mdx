title: "What is the difference between \"Trial Cancel\" and \"Trial Expire\" tags?"
---


The "Trial Cancel" and "Trial Expire" tags represent different stages in a user's trial journey:

*   **"Trial Cancel"** occurs when a user actively cancels their trial during the trial period, before it converts to a paid subscription.
    
*   **"Trial Expire"** occurs when the trial period ends without the user converting to a paid subscription. This can happen for two reasons:
    
    *   The user previously canceled their trial
        
    *   A billing issue prevented the conversion to a paid subscription ([read more here](/support/troubleshooting/4741512872-why-am-i-seeing-a-billing-issue-after-my-free-trial-ends))
        

### Example Timeline

Here's how these events would appear if a user signed up for a 1 week trial and cancels after a day:

*   Day 0: Trial Start
    
*   Day 1: Trial Cancel (user actively cancels)
    
*   Day 7: Trial Expire (trial period officially ends)
