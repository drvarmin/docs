Learn all about our brand new, completely free revenue charts. Track how your app is doing from a proceeds standpoint. Or, check into paywall conversions, refund rates, and much more. Plus, you can aggregate data using filters, and export anything to a .csv format.

Revenue charts are available to everyone, and you can use them with our SDK or by simply setting up revenue tracking with Superwall.
