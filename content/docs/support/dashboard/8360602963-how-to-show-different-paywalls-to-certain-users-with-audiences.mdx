With Superwall, you can easily test and experiment with paywalls in production in your iOS, Flutter, Android or React Native app. Here, Superwall's audience feature is demonstrated, which shows how you can easily present different paywalls based off of audiences you setup. This video will walk you through three different audiences being used, each with its own paywall:

*   Showing a paywall based upon users who tap a certain button.
    
*   Showing a paywall based upon the time of day locally.
    
*   And, using a general audience to show a paywall to those who don't fit the above audiences.
