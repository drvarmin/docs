title: "Why is initial conversion lower than new trials on some days?"
---


When looking at analytics data in Superwall, you may notice that the initial conversion numbers can sometimes be lower than new trials for the same day. This is due to how these metrics are calculated differently.

Initial conversion and new trials metrics differ in the following ways:

*   Initial conversion counts users who both download the app AND convert on a paywall within the specified time period
    
*   New trials are not cohorted based on install date - they simply show the total number of new trials started on that day regardless of when the user installed the app
    

For example, if on July 25th you see:

*   Initial conversions: 332
    
*   New trials: 346
    

This means that 332 users who installed the app on that day converted on a paywall, while 346 total users started trials (including users who may have installed the app on previous days).
