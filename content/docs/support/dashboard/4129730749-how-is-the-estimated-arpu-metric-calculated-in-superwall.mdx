title: "How is the Estimated ARPU metric calculated in Superwall?"
---


Answer
------

The Estimated ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) in Superwall is calculated using the following formula:

(Projected Trial Proceeds + Actual Proceeds) / Number of Users

The "estimated" component of this metric comes from the projected trial proceeds, which are calculated based on:

*   Historical trial conversion rates for specific products/paywalls
    

The accuracy of the Estimated ARPU improves over time as more trial conversion data becomes available for your campaigns.
