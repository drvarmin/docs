### What
Toggle [feature gating](/paywall-editor-settings#feature-gating) on a paywall to change whether or not a placement restricts access to features.

### Why
When you use "non-gated", it means users will still see a paywall _but_ will have access to whatever feature is behind that paywall. This can be useful to allow access to pro features for a limited time — which hopefully will lead to more conversions later on down the road.
