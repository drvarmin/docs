Use [custom actions](/custom-paywall-events#custom-paywall-actions) to trigger application-specific functionality or logic from within your app.

### Why
Custom actions allow you to fire any arbitrary logic inside your app, allowing you to navigate to certain places or trigger platform-specific APIs (such as playing haptic feedback when tapping on a button on iOS).
