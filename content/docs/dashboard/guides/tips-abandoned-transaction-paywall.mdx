### What
Transaction abandon discounts can boost revenue by offering discounts to users who start, but don't complete, in-app purchases. We've seen 25-40% of revenue come from this method in a few of our own apps, and it can be implemented in Superwall without an app update.

### Why
Somewhere around only 50% of users complete in-app purchases once they start. Offering discounts to those who showed interest, but hesitated, can convert them into paying customers.
