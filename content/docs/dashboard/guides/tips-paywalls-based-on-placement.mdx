### What
Using [audiences](campaigns-audience) within a campaign, you can:

1. Show unique paywalls for each one.
2. And, within an audience, you can show multiple paywalls based on a [percentage](/campaigns-audience#paywalls).

### Why
Our data clearly demonstrates that showing the right paywall, to the right user, and at the right time dramatically affects revenue. There is rarely a one-size-fits all paywall, so you should be testing different variations of them often.
