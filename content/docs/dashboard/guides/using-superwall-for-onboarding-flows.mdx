Superwall's flexible paywall system can be used for building engaging onboarding experiences. With multi-page paywalls, dynamic content, and powerful targeting rules, you can create interactive onboarding flows without shipping app updates. Here's a quick guide on how to get up and running.

## Creating an onboarding campaign

Start by creating a [campaign](/campaigns) specifically for onboarding:

1. Navigate to **Campaigns** in the dashboard sidebar
2. Click **+ New Campaign** 
3. Name it something like "User Onboarding"
4. Add a [placement](/campaigns-placements) to trigger your onboarding flow

## Triggering onboarding automatically

There are two main approaches to triggering onboarding:

### Using the `app_launch` placement

The [`app_launch`](/campaigns-standard-placements) standard placement fires automatically when your app launches. This is ideal for showing onboarding on first launch:

1. Add `app_launch` as a [placement](/campaigns-placements) to your onboarding campaign
2. In your [audience filters](/dashboard/dashboard-campaigns/campaigns-audience#using-user-properties-or-placement-parameters), add a custom user attribute called something like `hasCompletedOnboarding` and set the condition to "is not equal to" `true`.
3. When onboarding completes, [set the user attribute](/sdk/quickstart/setting-user-properties) in your SDK:

```swift iOS
// Swift
Superwall.shared.setUserAttributes(["hasCompletedOnboarding": true])

// Android
Superwall.instance.setUserAttributes(mapOf("hasCompletedOnboarding" to true))

// Flutter
Superwall.instance.setUserAttributes({
  "hasCompletedOnboarding": true
});

// React Native / Expo
await Superwall.shared.setUserAttributes({ hasCompletedOnboarding: true });
```

This prevents the onboarding from showing again on subsequent launches.

### Using a custom placement

For more control over when onboarding appears, create a custom placement and register it manually:

```swift iOS
// Swift
Superwall.shared.register(event: "start_onboarding")

// Android
Superwall.instance.register("start_onboarding")

// Flutter
Superwall.instance.register("start_onboarding");

// React Native / Expo
await Superwall.shared.register({ placement: "start_onboarding" });
```

This approach lets you trigger onboarding based on specific user actions, like completing account setup or reaching a certain screen.

## Building multi-page onboarding paywalls

Superwall's [Navigation component](/paywall-editor-navigation-component) is perfect for creating multi-page onboarding experiences. Check out our [Simple Onboarding](https://superwall.com/templates?templateId=119147) template to see this in action.

To create a multi-page onboarding paywall:

1. In the paywall editor, click **+** to add a new element
2. Select **Navigation** under the "Base Elements" section
3. Add your onboarding content pages using [stacks](/paywall-editor-stacks)
4. Add buttons with tap behaviors to navigate between pages, or use transitions like Push, Fade, or Slide

You can also use the [Slides component](/paywall-editor-slides-component) if you want gesture-driven navigation or the [Carousel component](/paywall-editor-carousel-component) if you want slides that auto-advance.

## Personalizing content with dynamic values

Use [variables](/paywall-editor-variables) and [dynamic values](/paywall-editor-dynamic-values) to show different content based on user attributes, device properties, or actions:

**Show different messages based on device type:**
```
if device.interfaceType is "ipad"
  then "Welcome to the best iPad experience"
else
  then "Welcome to your new favorite app"
```

**Display personalized content using user attributes:**
```
if user.accountType is "premium"
  then "Unlock your premium features"
else
  then "Discover what you can do"
```

This means you can go to certain pages based off a button they tapped showing a survey, change wording, which products to show, and more. Rely on dynamic values and variables to completely customize flows.

**Adjust layout based on onboarding progress:**

Track which slide users are on using the [slides element variable](/paywall-editor-slides-component#tracking-or-updating-the-displayed-element-in-slides) and conditionally show/hide elements or change copy accordingly.

## Best practices

- **Keep it concise:** 3-5 slides is usually optimal for onboarding
- **Use user attributes:** Track onboarding completion and progress to avoid showing it repeatedly
- **Test variations:** Create multiple audiences to A/B test different onboarding flows
- **Make it dismissible:** Consider adding a skip option for returning users
- **Track analytics:** Monitor your onboarding completion rates in the campaign metrics

Remember, since everything is managed through the dashboard, you can iterate on your onboarding experience without shipping app updates.

## Going forward
Superwall is currently building out more tools for onboarding, such as text boxes and text entry, and will be available soon.
