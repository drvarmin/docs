### Quickstart

<Steps>

    <Step title="Create a new Flutter app">
    	Under the hood, Superwall needs an app for each platform you're launched on, one for iOS and one for Android. Creating a new Flutter app in Superwall automatically creates both of them for you. If you have one but not the other, follow [this guide](/creating-applications) to create one on the missing platform.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Install the SDK">
    	Follow the [installation guide](/installation-via-pubspec) to install the SDK.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure the SDK">
    	Follow the [configuration guide](/configuring-the-sdk) to configure the SDK
    </Step>
