title: "PurchaseController"
description: "A protocol for handling Superwall's subscription-related logic with your own purchase implementation."
---

<Info>
**This protocol is not required.** By default, Superwall handles all subscription-related logic automatically.
</Info>

<Warning>
When implementing PurchaseController, you must manually update [`subscriptionStatus`](/ios/sdk-reference/subscriptionStatus) whenever the user's entitlements change.
</Warning>

## Purpose
Use this protocol only if you want complete control over purchase handling, such as when using RevenueCat or other third-party purchase frameworks.

## Signature
```swift
public protocol PurchaseController: AnyObject {
  @MainActor
  func purchase(product: StoreProduct) async -> PurchaseResult
  
  @MainActor
  func restorePurchases() async -> RestorationResult
}
```

## Parameters
<ParamTable>
| Method | Parameters | Return Type | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `purchase` | `product: StoreProduct` | `PurchaseResult` | Called when user initiates purchasing. Implement your purchase logic here. |
| `restorePurchases` | None | `RestorationResult` | Called when user initiates restore. Implement your restore logic here. |
</ParamTable>

## Returns / State
- `purchase()` returns a `PurchaseResult` (`.purchased`, `.failed(Error)`, or `.cancelled`)
- `restorePurchases()` returns a `RestorationResult` (`.restored` or `.failed(Error?)`)

When using a PurchaseController, you must also manage [`subscriptionStatus`](/ios/sdk-reference/subscriptionStatus) yourself.

## Usage
For implementation examples and detailed guidance, see [Using RevenueCat](/ios/guides/using-revenuecat).

<Tip>
This is commonly used with RevenueCat, StoreKit 2, or other third-party purchase frameworks where you want to maintain your existing purchase logic.
