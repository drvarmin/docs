title: "register()"
description: "A function that registers a placement that can be remotely configured to show a paywall and gate feature access."
---

## Purpose
Registers a placement so that when it's added to a campaign on the Superwall Dashboard, it can trigger a paywall and optionally gate access to a feature.

## Signature
```swift
public func register(
  placement: String,
  params: [String: Any]? = nil,
  handler: PaywallPresentationHandler? = nil,
  feature: @escaping () -> Void
)
```

```swift
public func register(
  placement: String,
  params: [String: Any]? = nil,
  handler: PaywallPresentationHandler? = nil
)
```

## Parameters
<ParamTable>
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `placement` | `String` | The name of the placement you wish to register. |
| `params` | `[String: Any]?` | Optional parameters to pass with your placement. These can be referenced within audience filters in your campaign. Keys beginning with `$` are reserved for Superwall and will be dropped. Arrays and dictionaries are currently unsupported and will be ignored. Defaults to `nil`. |
| `handler` | `PaywallPresentationHandler?` | A handler whose functions provide status updates for the paywall lifecycle. Defaults to `nil`. |
| `feature` | `(() -> Void)?` | An optional completion block representing the gated feature. It is executed based on the paywall's gating mode: called immediately for **Non-Gated**, called after the user subscribes or if already subscribed for **Gated**. |
</ParamTable>

## Returns / State
This function returns `Void`. If you supply a `feature` block, it will be executed according to the paywall's gating configuration, as described above.

## Usage
```swift
Superwall.shared.register(
  placement: "premium_feature",
  params: ["source": "onboarding"]
) {
  // Code that unlocks the premium feature
  openPremiumScreen()
}
```

```swift
Superwall.shared.register(
  placement: "onboarding_complete",
  params: ["source": "onboarding"],
  handler: self
)
```
