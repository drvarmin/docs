If you're seeing a paywall when you think you shouldn't—or not seeing one when you should—run through this checklist:

1. **Check your subscription status logic.**
   If you're [implementing subscription-related logic yourself](/advanced-configuration), make sure `Superwall.shared.subscriptionStatus` is kept in sync with the actual subscription status. If it's `.unknown` or `.active(_)`, the paywall won’t show unless explicitly overridden.

2. **Test device considerations.**
   If you’ve previously purchased a subscription, the paywall won’t show again. On iOS, if you’re using a local StoreKit config file, delete and reinstall the app to reset the device’s subscription state.

3. **Review your campaign configuration.**
   Confirm your placement name is spelled correctly and that all necessary properties are passed to match the audience filter. Also check for any holdout groups that might block the paywall.

4. **Verify product configuration.**
   If your paywall references unavailable or invalid product identifiers, you’ll see a console error. When using a StoreKit file, be sure to add your products before testing paywall presentation.
