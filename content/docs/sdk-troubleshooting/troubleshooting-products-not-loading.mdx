### iOS Checklist

- **On the Superwall dashboard:**
  - Ensure all paywalls include at least one product with a valid identifier.
- **In Xcode:**
  - Add products to your StoreKit file.
  - Match your app's bundle ID to App Store Connect.
  - Add In-App Purchase capability in the project.
- **In App Store Connect:**
  - Agreements are active.
  - Tax and banking info complete.
  - Products marked "Ready to Submit".
  - No products are in **"Missing Metadata"** status.
  - Product IDs match your paywall.
  - Wait at least 15 minutes after product creation.
- **In Production:**
  - Wait up to 72 hours after app release for products to appear.

### Android Checklist

- Users in Russia and Belarus don’t have access to Google Billing. In this instance, products won't load and paywalls won't show. The `onError` `PaywallPresentationHandler` handler will get called.
- Ensure the device/emulator has the Play Store and is signed in.
- Check that your `applicationId` matches what’s in the Play Store.

### RevenueCat Checklist

- Product IDs added and linked to an entitlement.
- If using offerings, the product is part of one.
