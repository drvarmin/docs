title: "Using the Presentation Handler"
description: "When and how to use per-presentation handlers for paywalls, and how they differ from global delegates."
---

Use a presentation handler when you need fine‑grained callbacks for a single paywall presentation. For global events across your app, use the platform’s delegate instead.

- iOS: see [`PaywallPresentationHandler`](/ios/sdk-reference/PaywallPresentationHandler) and [`SuperwallDelegate`](/ios/sdk-reference/SuperwallDelegate)
- Flutter: see [`PaywallPresentationHandler`](/flutter/sdk-reference/PaywallPresentationHandler) and [`SuperwallDelegate`](/flutter/sdk-reference/SuperwallDelegate)

Typical use cases:

- Show custom loading/placeholder UI while a specific paywall is presented
- Gate navigation based on that presentation’s result only
- Capture metrics tied to one presentation without implementing a global delegate

For end‑to‑end presenting patterns (registering or retrieving a paywall yourself), see:
