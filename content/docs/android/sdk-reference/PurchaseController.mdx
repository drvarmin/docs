title: "PurchaseController"
description: "An interface for handling Superwall's subscription-related logic with your own purchase implementation."
---

<Info>
**This interface is not required.** By default, Superwall handles all subscription-related logic automatically using Google Play Billing.
</Info>

<Warning>
When implementing PurchaseController, you must manually update [`subscriptionStatus`](/android/sdk-reference/subscriptionStatus) whenever the user's entitlements change.
</Warning>

## Purpose
Use this interface only if you want complete control over purchase handling, such as when using RevenueCat or other third-party purchase frameworks.

## Signature
```kotlin
interface PurchaseController {
    suspend fun purchase(
        activity: Activity,
        product: StoreProduct
    ): PurchaseResult
    
    suspend fun restorePurchases(): RestorationResult
}
```

```java
// Java
public interface PurchaseController {
    CompletableFuture<PurchaseResult> purchase(
        Activity activity, 
        StoreProduct product
    );
    
    CompletableFuture<RestorationResult> restorePurchases();
}
```

## Parameters
<ParamTable>
| Method | Parameters | Return Type | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `purchase` | `activity: Activity`, `product: StoreProduct` | `PurchaseResult` | Called when user initiates purchasing. Implement your purchase logic here. Activity is needed for Google Play Billing. |
| `restorePurchases` | None | `RestorationResult` | Called when user initiates restore. Implement your restore logic here. |
</ParamTable>

## Returns / State
- `purchase()` returns a `PurchaseResult` (`.Purchased`, `.Failed(Throwable)`, `.Cancelled`, or `.Pending`)
- `restorePurchases()` returns a `RestorationResult` (`.Restored` or `.Failed(Throwable?)`)

When using a PurchaseController, you must also manage [`subscriptionStatus`](/android/sdk-reference/subscriptionStatus) yourself.
