title: "register()"
description: "A function that registers a placement that can be remotely configured to show a paywall and gate feature access."
---

## Purpose
Registers a placement so that when it's added to a campaign on the Superwall Dashboard, it can trigger a paywall and optionally gate access to a feature.

## Signature
```kotlin
fun Superwall.register(
    placement: String,
    params: Map<String, Any>? = null,
    handler: PaywallPresentationHandler? = null,
    feature: () -> Unit,
)
```

```kotlin
fun Superwall.register(
    placement: String,
    params: Map<String, Any>? = null,
    handler: PaywallPresentationHandler? = null,
)
```

## Parameters
<ParamTable>
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `placement` | `String` | The name of the placement you wish to register. |
| `params` | `Map<String, Any>?` | Optional parameters to pass with your placement. These can be referenced within campaign rules. Keys beginning with `$` are reserved for Superwall and will be dropped. Arrays and nested maps are currently unsupported and will be ignored. Defaults to `null`. |
| `handler` | `PaywallPresentationHandler?` | A handler whose functions provide status updates for the paywall lifecycle. Defaults to `null`. |
| `feature` | `() -> Unit` | A completion block representing the gated feature. It is executed based on the paywall's gating mode: called immediately for **Non-Gated**, called after the user subscribes or if already subscribed for **Gated**. |
</ParamTable>

## Returns / State
This function returns `Unit`. If you supply a `feature` lambda, it will be executed according to the paywall's gating configuration, as described above.

## Usage

<CodeGroup>

```swift iOS
func pressedWorkoutButton() {
  // remotely decide if a paywall is shown and if
  // navigation.startWorkout() is a paid-only feature
  Superwall.shared.register(placement: "StartWorkout") {
    navigation.startWorkout()
  }
}
```

```kotlin Android
fun pressedWorkoutButton() {
  // remotely decide if a paywall is shown and if
  // navigation.startWorkout() is a paid-only feature
  Superwall.instance.register("StartWorkout") {
    navigation.startWorkout()
  }
}
```

```dart Flutter
void pressedWorkoutButton() {
  // remotely decide if a paywall is shown and if
  // navigation.startWorkout() is a paid-only feature
  Superwall.shared.registerPlacement('StartWorkout', feature: () {
      navigation.startWorkout();
  });
}
```

```typescript React Native
// remotely decide if a paywall is shown and if
// navigation.startWorkout() is a paid-only feature
Superwall.shared.register({
  placement: 'StartWorkout',
  feature: () => {
    navigation.navigate('LaunchedFeature', {
      value: 'Non-gated feature launched',
    });
  } 
});
```

</CodeGroup>

Register without feature gating:
```kotlin
Superwall.instance.register(
    placement = "onboarding_complete",
    params = mapOf("source" to "onboarding"),
    handler = this
)
```
