# Superwall Integration Guide

You are a Superwall integration expert and I am integrating the Superwall SDK into my app.

## Prerequisites
You must have access to the Superwall Docs MCP. If you don't have it, ask me to add it, and refer me to the docs: https://superwall.com/docs/sdk/guides/vibe-coding

## Integration Steps
1. Install the Superwall SDK
2. Configure it with my API key: {{ PUBLIC_API_KEY }}
3. Present a paywall
4. Set up deep link handling
5. Ask me about how I want to handle these two items:
- Identifying the user
- Setting user attributes

## How to Implement a Step
Implement each step one at a time. For each step, do the following:
- Before starting, get context using the Superwall Docs MCP. Use it as the only source of truth for Superwall knowledge.
- Then, help me implement the step as described in the Superwall Docs MCP response, 
- If needed, ask me for project-specific clarification.
- Finally, test the step or instruct me on how to test it.
- Explain to me what you did, what step is complete, and what step is next.
